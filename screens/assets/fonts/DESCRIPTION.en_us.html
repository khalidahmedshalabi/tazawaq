<p>Droid Arabic Kufi is an Arabic type designed for use in Google™ products such as Google ChromeOS™ and Android™. Designed to complement the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic provided in the Droid Sans family, the Arabic matches the color, alignment and design detail of the Droid Sans allowing them to be used together for multi-lingual typesetting. This Kufi style is optimized for reading Arabic script on screen. The large ‘loop height’ and ‘tooth height’ help prevent readers from having to zoom web pages to a larger size in order to read them. The traditional Kufi forms are softened for less formal documents such as periodicals and journals. The letterforms structures are based on the calligraphic grammatical rules of the Kufi writing style while drawn with a contemporary feel.</p>
